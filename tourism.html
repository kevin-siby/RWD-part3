        <h4> IDUKKI </h4>
        <p> Idukki is a picturesque, landlocked district in Kerala, India, established in 1972, renowned for its mountainous Western Ghats terrain and dense forests. Known as the "spice garden of Kerala," it is a major producer of cardamom, pepper, and tea. With over 97% of its area covered by forests and rugged terrain, it has the lowest population density in the state. The district is also vital for power generation, supplying about 66% of Kerala's electricity through various hydroelectric projects, most notably the Idukki Dam. </p>
